Database - contains many tables
Relation(or table) - contains tuples and attributes
Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track
Attribute(also column or field) -  one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row
(reference form FreeCodeCamp)

A realtion is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints(Wikipedia)(FreeCodeCamp)

SQL = Strcutured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the databse

Create a table / Retrieve some data / Insert data / Delete data

Common database Systems

Three major Database Management System in wide use

Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable

MySql - Simpler but very fast and scalable - commercial open source

SqlServer - Very nice - from Microsoft(also Access)

Many other smaller projects, free and open source 
HSQL, SQLite, Postgres... (From FreeCodeCamp)
