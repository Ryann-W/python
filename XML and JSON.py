# It started as a simplified subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML), and is designed to be relatively
# human-legible

# Tags indicate the beginning and ending of elements
# Attributes - Keywords/value pairs on the opening tag of XML
# Serialize/ De-Serialize - Convert data in one program into a common format that can be storted and/or transmitted between systems
# in a programming language-independent manner
